# ECU Physics Labs Jupyter Notebooks for Regression Analysis in Python

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that use *Python* to do linear regression 
analysis to use for data analysis for introductory physics labs at ECU.

* Run on Binder: 
    [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sprague252/PhysLabsPython/master?urlpath=lab) 
    No account required, but it may take time for the configuration to load and build. 
    Once the configuration finishes building, open the notebook `RegressionPy.ipynb`.
