# ECU Physics Labs Jupyter Notebooks for Regression Analysis in Python

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that use *Python* to do linear regression analysis to use for data analysis for introductory physics labs at ECU.

* Run on Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sprague252/PhysLabsPython/master?filepath=RegressionPy.ipynb) No account required, but it may take time for the configuration to load and build. Once the configuration finishes building, open the notebook `RegressionPy.ipynb`.

* Run on Azure: [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/sprague252/PhysLabsPython) Sign in with Microsoft (or ECU) account. Follow the prompts to import the repository.  Click the run button, and then open the notebook `RegressionPy.ipynb`.
